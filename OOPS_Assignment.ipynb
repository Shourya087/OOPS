        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "-- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects rather than functions or logic. These objects represent real-world entities and combine data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single unit\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP\n",
        "-- class is a blueprint or a template to create objects. it defines attributes and methods\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP\n",
        "-- object is an instance of a class\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        "-- abstraction is hiding complex implementation details and showing only features. encapsulation is bundling data and methods together\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python\n",
        "-- dunder methods are the double underscore methods. these are special methods which are built in class functions in python\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "-- inheritance is concept where child class inherits the methods and attributes of the parent class\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "-- polymorphism refers to an object taking several forms depending on the methods/data\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python\n",
        "-- it means restricting direct access to attributes to protect internal state of the object. it is achieved using __ for private and _ for protected\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python\n",
        "-- init function which is used to initialize objects\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python\n",
        "-- Defined with the @classmethod decorator.First parameter is always cls, which refers to the class itself (not the instance) Defined with the @staticmethod decorator. Do not take self (instance) or cls (class) as the first parameter. Behave like normal functions\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python\n",
        "-- python doesnt support method overloading directly but defining multiple methods in same class with same name the last one overrides the previous ones\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP\n",
        "-- in inheritance the child class overrides the method which is also in parent class with same name\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python\n",
        "-- it is used to define methods that can be accessed like attributes. it turns method into read only attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        "-- code reusability, flexiblility in code, simpler code\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python\n",
        "-- it is a class thta cant be instantiated directly and is meant to serve as a blueprint for other classes\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP\n",
        "-- encapsulation, inheritance, scalability, polymorphism, abstraction, security\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
        "-- Class varaibles - shared across all objects of the class, defined inside the class but outside any methods , changing a class variable affects all instances of the class, used for common properties that should be the same for every object\n",
        "Instance variable - unique to each object, defined inside the constructor (__init__) using self, changing an instance variable affects only that particular object, used for object-specific properties\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        "-- inheritance where attributes and methods are inherited from more than 1 parent\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        "-- str method is used to provide human readable string representation, repr method is used to provide developer oriented string representation\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python\n",
        "-- super function in Python is used to call method from parent class inside a child subclass\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "-- del method is the destructor method . it is called qhen object is about to be destroyed\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        "-- staticmethod declares a method that does not depend on the class (cls) or instance (self). classmethod declares a method that operates on the class itself, not on instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance\n",
        "-- parent class defines a method child classes override the method subclasses\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP\n",
        "-- method chaining is a programming technique where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single line of code\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python\n",
        "-- the call method is a special (dunder) method in python that allows an object of a class to be called like a function.\n",
